  /// After calling this function, SDK initiates a mixing stream request to the ZEGO audio and video cloud. The ZEGO audio and video cloud will find the current publishing stream and perform video layer blending according to the parameters of the mixing stream task requested by ZegoExpressEngine.
  /// When you need to update the mixing stream task, that is, the input stream list needs to be updated when the input stream increases or decreases, you can update the field of the [ZegoMixerTask] object inputList and call this function again to pass the same [ZegoMixerTask] object to update the mixing stream task.
  /// If an exception occurs when requesting to start the mixing stream task, for example, the most common mix input stream does not exist, it will be given from the callback error code. For specific error codes, please refer to the error codes document https://doc-en.zego.im/en/5548.html for details.

The previous mixing stream task will not be stopped automatically until 90 seconds after the input stream of the previous mixing stream task does not exist.
  /// When using the mixing stream function of the ZEGO audio and video cloud service, you should pay attention to the start of the next mixing stream task, and should stop the previous mixing stream task, so as not to cause the anchor has started the next streaming task and mixing with other anchors, and the audience is still playing the output stream of the previous mixing stream task.
